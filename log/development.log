                  <span>É o que testemunhamos neste concerto gravado no chão do Marco Zero, na ilha holandesa do Recife Velho ou Antigo, porta e farol da cidade para o mundo. Ouviram não só do Ipiranga, ouviram d´África, onde os tambores da Nação fazem reverberar o escambo de oferendas no terreiro afro-beat. 
  
  Mais do que um show, o DVD mostra a liga orgânica entre a cidade e a banda. Rios, pontes, overdrives e impressionantes coreografias da massa vistas por câmeras aéreas. Os “extras” completam essa lição geográfica da fome afetiva com um rolê por alguns pontos como o Mercado de São José e o bairro de Peixinhos, Olinda, de onde veio a “cozinha” percussiva do grupo. 
  
  No repertório, clássicos dos tempos de Chico Science são mesclados com a história da NZ até hoje. Fred 04, parceiro da origem do mangue beat; Siba com a loa-metal da sua Fuloresta; Arnaldo Antunes e Paralamas do Sucesso fazem participações especiais. 
  
  Este DVD é um documento digno daquela que é, desde o nascedouro, nos anos 90, a melhor e mais expressiva banda brasileira. Não é fácil se manter com essa garantia e resistência do grupo formado por Jorge Du Peixe, Pupillo, Lúcio Maia, Dengue, Toca Ogan, Gilmar Bola 8, Da Lua e Marcos Matia. - See more at: http://www.nacaozumbi.com.br/#sthash.ZkyUYww6.dpuf</span>

                  <span>É o que testemunhamos neste concerto gravado no chão do Marco Zero, na ilha holandesa do Recife Velho ou Antigo, porta e farol da cidade para o mundo. Ouviram não só do Ipiranga, ouviram d´África, onde os tambores da Nação fazem reverberar o escambo de oferendas no terreiro afro-beat. 
  
  Mais do que um show, o DVD mostra a liga orgânica entre a cidade e a banda. Rios, pontes, overdrives e impressionantes coreografias da massa vistas por câmeras aéreas. Os “extras” completam essa lição geográfica da fome afetiva com um rolê por alguns pontos como o Mercado de São José e o bairro de Peixinhos, Olinda, de onde veio a “cozinha” percussiva do grupo. 
  
  No repertório, clássicos dos tempos de Chico Science são mesclados com a história da NZ até hoje. Fred 04, parceiro da origem do mangue beat; Siba com a loa-metal da sua Fuloresta; Arnaldo Antunes e Paralamas do Sucesso fazem participações especiais. 
  
  Este DVD é um documento digno daquela que é, desde o nascedouro, nos anos 90, a melhor e mais expressiva banda brasileira. Não é fácil se manter com essa garantia e resistência do grupo formado por Jorge Du Peixe, Pupillo, Lúcio Maia, Dengue, Toca Ogan, Gilmar Bola 8, Da Lua e Marcos Matia. - See more at: http://www.nacaozumbi.com.br/#sthash.ZkyUYww6.dpuf</span>

Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".):
